- .env in node project we have .env file where we define our port number
- process modules is global object for node js that provide information about and control over the current node.js process
**************
npm i dotenv package which help to access .env file with help of process modules

          const express = require("express");
          
          const app = express();
          
     in here app is instance of express application which can be created by using express()
          use:
          define routes & respond to request
          handle middlewar - add functionality of middlewar to process instance before they reach to routes
          start server - listen & start the server

in our project we need to pass data from client to server -->> we need json object 
          which help to parse data from client to server
**************
          app.use(express.json())
in express stack how it work?
          stack is sequence of middlewar funtion that express help to process request

          basically when request come to server middlewar function in stack start to run by order 
          if any error occur then it move to error-handling middlewar 
          else it move to router

we need handle operation in mongodb server so we need to maintain our function as async
          if function in "async" then error may occur so need to place your code inside try catch block
          instead of using try catch block in express middlewar named "express-async-handler" which help if any error occur it catch and throw error handler
